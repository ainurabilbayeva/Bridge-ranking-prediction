# Bridge-ranking-prediction

This study utilizes neural networks to perform prediction on the condition rating of the superstructure and substructures of bridges. The dataset is obtained from :

- The National Bridge Inventory (NBI) for bridge information from 1992 to 2020.

This study forces on the bridges in the state of Maryland, though the program can take input data from any state (s). The NBI dataset was condensed to only include items reverent to the deterioration model. The two machine learning approaches used in
this study are artificial neural networks and data mining. The artificial neural network was constructed using Python and the data mining analysis was carried out by Weka. The national bridge inventory dataset is provided by the Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA) and is available to the public.
